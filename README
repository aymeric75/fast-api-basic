Basic API built on FastAPI

Allows to POST, GET, DELETE informations on PostgreSQL databases

Once the databases+tables+columns are created server side, you can post on IP_ADDRESS:8000/computers (or using the brower with IP_ADDRESS:8000/computers/docs) something like:

{
	db_name : "anythingyouwant",
	table_name : "anything",
	other : [
			{name : "column1",
			value : "value1"},
			{name : "column2",
			value : "value2"}
	],
	constraint_col: "id" # use "id" by default, otherwise only applicable to a UNIQUE column

}	


(a auto-increment id column (int) and a created_time column (string) are automatically created during the POST)


Front-end created with Tailwindcss and Htmlx (no Javascript required !): access it with IP_ADDRESS:8000/computers/{db_name}/{table_name}
